To install STAMP, run the BUILD script in this directory using:

./BUILD <system-type>

where <system-type> is one of:

linux
osx 
dec
sgi
sun

The executables will be installed in bin/<system-type>/.

If your system is not one of these, the linux target should
work on similar systems such as Cygwin, MinGW and FreeBSD,
although it might require changes to the makefile.linux
file in the src/ directory.

Version 4.4 (May 2010):  Note that the only operating systems we
now test are linux and osx.  I'm afraid we can't offer help
with other operating systems as we don't have the hardware 
to test on.
