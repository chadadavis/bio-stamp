Pre-compiled executables are available in bin/sgi, bin/sun or bin/osf for
IRIX 5.2, Sun OS 4.1.1 or DEC OSF/1 V3.0 respectively.

If these don't work, you can install STAMP on your system by typing:

BUILD <sgi/sun/osf>  if you are running IRIX 5.2, Sun OS 4.1.1 or DEC OSF/1 V3.0 
respectively.  

If you are using some other system, you will need to create a new makefile
in the src/ directory by copying one of the others and modifying it accordingly.

See doc/stamp.tex or doc/stamp.ps for versions of the STAMP documentation in
LaTeX or PostScript format respectively.

To use the program you must first set the STAMPDIR environment variable:
	
	setenv STAMPDIR <this directory>/defs/

and you need either to put bin/<sgi/sun/osf/etc.> in your path, or
move/link the appropriate executables to some central place like
/usr/local/bin/.

The files doc/licence and doc/appendix_A are the text and 
postscript files corresponding to the licence agreement that 
should have already been signed.
