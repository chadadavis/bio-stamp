	* New ChangeLog to celebrate moving to Google Project Hosting
	* Merged 4.4 tag to trunk and verifying tests in preparation for 4.5 release

1999-04-26  
	* New features to Version 4.2 include:
	1. Programs for merging sequence/structure alignments/superimpositions
	from multiple sources.
	2. Assignment of probability values after Murzin (1993, JMB, 689-694)
	to assess whether an observed structural similarity implies a common
	superfamily (and thus a common ancestor, and usually a common
	molecular function).  Note that these probability values can reveal
	homology when sequence identities are insignificant.
	3. The ability to read compressed PDB and DSSP files, and to read
	distr/xx formatted PDB directories.
	4. Programs for converting STAMP alignments (or indeed any alignment)
	to various standard formats such as CLUSTAL and MSF.
