STAMP is a suite of programs for the comparison and alignment of protein three dimensional structures.  The suite will multiply align structures and produce a corresponding sequence alignment with confidence values associated with each aligned position.  The software will also search a database of protein structures to identify structurally similar proteins.  The suite includes a number of utility programs for the manipulation of protein structures.

INSTALL
     Do
      ./configure && make install

    You may need to be root to installed to the default location:
      ./configure && sudo make install

    Otherwise, specify an alternate directory installation prefix:
      ./configure --prefix=/usr/local && make install

    Or, if checked out from the source repository, then first do:
      autoreconf --install
      ./configure && make install

    If installing on Ubuntu and the math library (libm) isn't found do:

      LDADD=-lm make

    Once installed, you will want to edit the file:
      $prefix/share/stamp/pdb.directories 
    to set the path and file pattern for your PDB files

    The file format is explained here:
