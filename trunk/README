STAMP is a suite of programs for the comparison and alignment of protein three dimensional structures.  The suite will multiply align structures and produce a corresponding sequence alignment with confidence values associated with each aligned position.  The software will also search a database of protein structures to identify structurally similar proteins.  The suite includes a number of utility programs for the manipulation of protein structures.
